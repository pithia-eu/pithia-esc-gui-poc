        How long does validation take?
    </summary>
    <p class="mt-2">
        A metadata file will usually take up to 20 seconds
        to a minute to finish validating, which is usually
        taken up by the time it takes to complete XSD
        validation.

                <p class="mt-2">
                    Metadata files are validated to ensure that
                    the e-Science Centre will be able to process
                    and display the contents of each file and that
                    links to ontology terms and other metadata
                    registrations will work as expected.
