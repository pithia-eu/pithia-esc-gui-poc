    The e-Science Centre holds <strong>metadata documents</strong>
    that describe a wide variety of <strong>Data Collections</strong>
    relevant to PITHIA-NRF. Data Collections can be sensor measurements,
    outputs of numerical models, computed indicators of helio- and
    geospace activity. They can be <strong>pre-computed</strong> (stored
    as permanent datasets) or <strong>run on-demand</strong> with custom
    parameters. The data access can be provided by the <strong>original
    data owners</strong> using their resources (web pages, standardized
    API calls) or by <strong>running installed models</strong> at eSC
    computer park.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>The &quot;All Data Collections&quot; function lists all
    collections</strong>, sorted alphabetically by their name.
