<p>
    The e-Science Centre holds <strong>metadata documents</strong>
    that describe a wide variety of <strong>Data Collections</strong>
    relevant to PITHIA-NRF.
    
    A subset of relevant Data Collection may be retrieved for
    inspection by specifying various search criteria.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>The &quot;Search Data Collections by content&quot; uses
    standard dictionary terms</strong> to find data of relevant content.
</p>
<p>
    Each Data Collection is registered using standard terminology to
    describe it. The terminology includes
    (a) PITHIA schema based on the <em>science-neutral</em> ISO
    19156:2023 standard for Observations and Measurements and
    (b) <em>Space Physics specific</em> dictionaries of the standard
    terms (Ontology).
</p>
<p>
    Search Data Collections by content presents selectable items in
    the schema and ontology dictionaries to locate data collections
    of interest.
    
    The PITHIA schema items include:
    1. Feature of Interest,
    2. Computation and Instrument types, and
    3. Observed Property.
    Ontology provides standard terms for the check-boxes under 1, 2,
    and 3.
